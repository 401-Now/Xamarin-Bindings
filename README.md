**Note:** this is just a work-in-progress experiment for now â€¦ you know, "offered as-is" kind of deal. It may or may not be developed further, and may or may not be supported in the future.

**One more note:** this repo includes some submodules.  
Clone with `git clone --recursive`, or run `git submodule update --init` before use.
