# Estimote Xamarin Bindings

An example Visual Studio Solution which shows how to bind Estimote SDKs to Xamarin. Includes example apps which show how to use the generated bindings.

## Getting started

This repo includes submodules. Clone with `git clone --recursive`, or run `git submodule update --init` before use.

To build the Android bindings, you also need to download all the necessary JARs and AARs:

```
$ cd Xamarin-Bindings
$ ./Estimote.Android.Proximity/Scripts/download_jars.sh
```
